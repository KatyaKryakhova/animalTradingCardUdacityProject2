               <p>Polar bears and noble and beautiful creatures. Unfortunately, beacause of the global warming they have to swim further and further for food because the ice is melting. As a result they lose weight, become too weak to hunt and starve to death. Let's do our best to decrease our carbon footprint and save those amazing creatures from distinction!
